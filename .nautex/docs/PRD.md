#  Product Specification
## [PRD-1] Introduction & Vision
This document outlines the requirements for a Codebase Summarization Tool. The primary vision is to create a "semantic layer" over a software codebase, enabling AI coding agents to gain a high-level understanding of the project's structure and content without needing to process every individual file.

The core problem being solved is the token limit and inefficiency of current AI coding agents, which must ingest large amounts of code into their context window to perform tasks. This tool will generate concise, machine-readable summary files (

agents.md

) within each directory of a codebase. These summaries will provide essential context in a token-efficient manner, allowing an AI agent to navigate and comprehend the entire codebase quickly and effectively.

The high-level goal is to accelerate AI-driven software development by providing agents with structured, high-signal summaries of the code they are tasked to work on.

### [PRD-2] Target Audience & User Personas
#### [PRD-3] Primary User: AI Coding Agent
[PRD-4] Description: An automated or semi-automated software program designed to read, understand, and write code. 

[PRD-5] Goals: 

[PRD-6] To quickly understand the purpose and structure of a folder or the entire codebase. 

[PRD-7] To identify relevant files, APIs, and required expertise for a given task. 

[PRD-8] To operate efficiently by minimizing the amount of code (tokens) it needs to process. 

[PRD-9] Motivations: Successfully completing coding tasks with accuracy and speed while staying within operational context limits. 

#### [PRD-10] Secondary User: Developer / DevOps Engineer
[PRD-11] Description: The human operator responsible for developing software and maintaining the development infrastructure. 

[PRD-12] Goals: 

[PRD-13] To integrate the summarization tool into their existing development workflow (IDE, Version Control, CI/CD). 

[PRD-14] To ensure the generated summaries are accurate and consistently up-to-date. 

[PRD-15] To improve the effectiveness of the AI coding agents they use. 

[PRD-16] Motivations: To leverage AI to accelerate development, reduce manual code analysis, and improve the quality of AI-generated contributions. 

### [PRD-17] User Stories / Use Cases
#### [PRD-18] Use Case 1: AI Agent Explores the Codebase
[PRD-19] As an AI coding agent, 

[PRD-20] I want to read a root-level agents.md file that provides a table of contents to other summaries, 

[PRD-21] so that I can strategically navigate to the most relevant parts of the codebase without reading every file. 

#### [PRD-22] Use Case 2: AI Agent Analyzes a Specific Module
[PRD-23] As an AI coding agent, 

[PRD-24] I want to read the agents.md file within a specific directory, 

[PRD-25] so that I can understand the types of files, the required skills to modify them, and the APIs they expose, allowing me to formulate a plan for my coding task. 

#### [PRD-26] Use Case 3: Developer Manually Generates Summaries
[PRD-27] As a developer, 

[PRD-28] I want to manually trigger the generation of all agents.md files, 

[PRD-29] so that I can create a baseline summary for a new project or refresh the summaries on demand. 

#### [PRD-30] Use Case 4: DevOps Engineer Automates Summary Updates
[PRD-31] As a DevOps engineer, 

[PRD-32] I want to configure the summarization tool to run automatically within our CI/CD pipeline, 

[PRD-33] so that the agents.md files are always synchronized with the latest changes to the codebase, ensuring AI agents have accurate context. 

### [PRD-34] Functional Requirements
#### [PRD-35] Codebase Analysis
[PRD-36] The system must perform a depth-first traversal of a given codebase directory structure. 

[PRD-37] In each directory it traverses, the system must generate a file named agents.md. 

#### [PRD-38] File Structure and Content
[PRD-39] The generated agents.md file must be optimized for parsing by Large Language Models (LLMs). 

[PRD-40] The file must begin with a header containing a Table of Contents (TOC). 

[PRD-41] The very first text in the file must declare the size of the TOC. 

[PRD-42] The TOC size declaration must specify the number of lines the TOC occupies. The format will be TOC-LINES: &lt;number&gt; (e.g., TOC-LINES: 5). 

[PRD-43] The TOC must list each predefined content section that follows it. 

[PRD-44] Each entry in the TOC must specify the section name, its starting line number, and its ending line number within the agents.md file. 

#### [PRD-45] Content Sections
[PRD-46] The system must generate the following predefined sections within each agents.md file: 

[PRD-47] File Types: A summary of the types of files present in the current directory (e.g., .js, .py, .css). 

[PRD-48] Required Skillsets: An identification of the expertise best suited to work with the files in the directory. 

[PRD-49] Skillsets will be determined via a dynamic tag system. The system will analyze file contents to derive relevant tags (e.g., "React," "Django," "API-Design"). 

[PRD-50] APIs: A list of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) found within the files of the directory. 

[PRD-51] Each listed API should include a semantic description of its purpose where applicable. 

[PRD-52] The system will use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a concise, one-sentence summary of the API's function based on its name and code. 

#### [PRD-53] Versioning and Metadata
[PRD-54] Each agents.md file must include version metadata. 

[PRD-55] This metadata should allow a user or agent to trace when the summary was last generated. 

[PRD-56] The metadata must include the source control commit hash corresponding to the codebase state when the summary was generated (e.g., Commit: a1b2c3d). This may be omitted if the tool is run on uncommitted changes. Additionally, the metadata should include an ISO 8601 timestamp and, when applicable, the CI/CD build number (e.g., Last-Generated: 2023-10-27T10:00:00Z, Build: 12345). 

#### [PRD-57] Generation Triggers
[PRD-58] The system must support manual, on-demand generation of the agents.md files. 

[PRD-59] The system must support automatic generation triggered by events in the development lifecycle. 

[PRD-60] The automatic generation must be configurable to ensure the agents.md files do not become out of sync with the codebase. 

#### [PRD-62] Platform and Language Support
[PRD-63] The system must be designed with future support for multiple programming languages in mind. 

[PRD-64] The system should be capable of generating framework-specific summaries where relevant. 

#### [PRD-65] Integrations
[PRD-66] The system must be designed to integrate with version control systems. 

[PRD-67] The system must be designed to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. 

[PRD-68] The system must be designed with future IDE integration in mind. 

#### [PRD-102] Usage Metrics Collection
[PRD-101] The system must collect metrics on LLM usage. This includes logging API calls, tracking token counts (prompt, completion, and total), and calculating associated costs. 

### [PRD-69] Non-Functional Requirements
#### [PRD-70] Usability
[PRD-71] The format of the agents.md file must be highly readable and parsable by LLMs to ensure efficient consumption by AI agents. 

#### [PRD-72] Reliability
[PRD-73] The content of the agents.md files must accurately reflect the state of the codebase at the time of generation. 

[PRD-74] The automated update mechanism must be robust to prevent the semantic layer from becoming out of sync with the source code. 

#### [PRD-75] Performance
[PRD-76] The system must be capable of processing large codebases. 

[PRD-78] The system should be able to scan a medium-sized repository (e.g., 10,000 files) in under 5 minutes on a typical CI/CD runner. 

[PRD-100] The generation of a single agents.md file for a directory containing up to 100 files should not exceed 30 seconds. 

### [PRD-79] Scope
#### [PRD-80] In Scope for MVP
[PRD-81] A core engine that traverses directories and generates agents.md files. 

[PRD-82] Support for a limited, core set of common programming languages to validate the concept. 

[PRD-83] Generation of the agents.md file with the specified TOC, header, and content sections (File Types, Skillsets, APIs). 

[PRD-84] Inclusion of version metadata in each generated file. 

[PRD-85] Both manual and automated (hook-based) generation triggers. 

[PRD-86] Primary focus on integration with version control and CI/CD systems. 

#### [PRD-87] Out of Scope for MVP
[PRD-88] A plugin-based architecture for extending language support. This will be considered for a future release after the core concept is validated. 

[PRD-89] Advanced metadata analysis, such as file dependencies, version/revision history of individual files, or performance/structural metrics. 

[PRD-90] A fully-featured IDE integration with a user interface. 

### [PRD-91] Success Metrics
[PRD-92] Defining and implementing a measurement framework for success metrics is considered out of scope for the MVP due to added complexity. This will be revisited in a future release. Potential metrics to consider post-MVP include Token Efficiency Ratio, AI Task Completion Rate, and developer adoption. 

### [PRD-93] Assumptions & Dependencies
#### [PRD-94] Assumptions
[PRD-95] Users have access to AI coding agents capable of reading files from a workspace. 

[PRD-96] The codebases to be analyzed are stored in standard directory structures accessible by the tool. 

[PRD-97] The primary value is in providing context to automated agents, and human readability of the agents.md file is a secondary benefit. 

#### [PRD-98] Dependencies
[PRD-99] The tool's effectiveness is dependent on its integration with version control systems (like Git) and CI/CD platforms (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).
